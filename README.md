# A Door in the Wall

This game, made in the FOSS **Godot Engine**, is a puzzle game enspired by Escher, where the basic laws of space don't always apply.
It takes the impossible, such as non-euclidean geometry, and treats it as though it were completely normal.
It doesn't care what's possible and impossible. It does what it wants.
And what it wants is to make the impossible possible.
